Questions

Imagine you are working for a small bank, attempting to analyze fraudulent credit card transactions.
You are given a list of strings describing credit card transactions for a single day. 
All strings are pipe‚Äêdelimited and will take the form of 
<person name>|<integer whole dollar amount>|<location>|<integer time in minutes since 00:00).> 
The list is sorted in ascending order by time.

Your job is to return a list of people's names whose accounts reflect suspicious activity. 
A person's account reflects suspicious activity if you see of the following:
1. A transaction spending more than $3000
2. A transaction for which the next transaction for the same person differs in location, 
and is less than an hour later

The list you return should be ordered by when the first suspicious was detected. 
For the second type of fraud, consider the "first suspicious activity" to be the earlier of the two transactions.

You have to complete the function getSuspiciousActivity to return the list of suspicious activities. 
The list you return should contain the person names as they appeared in the input. 
Please note that the first line of the input is the number of transactions in the array.

Sample Input 1:
Shilpa|500|California|63
Tom|25|New York|615
Krasi|9000|California|1230
Tom|25|New York|1235
Tom|25|New York|1238
Shilpa|50|Michigan|1300
Matt|90000|Georgia|1305
Jay|100000|Virginia|1310
Krasi|49|Florida|1320
Krasi|83|California|1325
Shilpa|50|California|1350

Sample Output 1:
Krasi
Shilpa
Matt
Jay

Explanation
Krasi is first because she has exhibited amount fraud before any other account exhibited either types of fraud 
(she then later also committed location fraud, but this doesn't matter). 
Shilpa is second, having committed location fraud where the first transaction took place before either of Matt or Jay's amount fraud.
Matt and Jay both exhibited amount fraud, but Matt's fraud was recorded before Jay's. 
Tom is not on this list because he did not commit either type of fraud.
