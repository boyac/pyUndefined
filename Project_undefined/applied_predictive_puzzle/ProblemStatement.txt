Write some code that generates the optimal set of job assignments.
Important decisions are being made: 
1. what kind of opportunity to pursue,
2. where to pursue it, 
3. and who to have with you along the way.


Class VariablestoConsider:
  
  def JobsOffers():
    Jobs: Each type of job has certain benefits and drawbacks along 
    several dimensions (Pay, Hours, Impact, Opportunity to Learn)
  
  def YourPersonality():
    Personalities: Accordingly, different types of people have different sets of preferences 
    across these job dimensions. These preferences can be thought of as coefficients for the 
    utility offered in each dimension (Pay, Hours, Impact, Opportunity to Learn)

  def Relationship():
    Lastly, people don't consider their job choices in a vacuum; 
    their utility derived from a job is a function of both the job itself and the people around them. 
    Since jobs are associated with specific geographies, the geography of the job alone can have a sizable impact on people's happiness.
